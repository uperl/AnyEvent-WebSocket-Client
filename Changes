  - Fixed a bug where adding next_message callback within a next_message
    callback was called immediately with the same message (gh#39 xavery++)

  - Production version functionally identical to the 0.47_01 release.

  - Production version functionally identical to the 0.42_01 release.

0.42_01   2017-10-18 11:45:16 -0400
  - You can now unregister event callbacks.
  - The 'on' method for AnyEvent::WebSocket::Connection now returns a
    code ref that can be used to unregister the callback.
  - The 'each_message' event also gets a code ref that can be used to
    unregister the callback.

  [WARNING: change in behavior]
  - The 'on' method for AnyEvent::WebSocket::Connection used to return
    the connection object, the intent was to allow chaining of 'on' calls,
    but this was never documented, and I don't believe it was ever used.
  - The 'each_message' event has a different number of arguments, which
    could break code that is using 'pop' to get the message instead of
    using the second argument position.  If you were following the examples
    in the documentation you wouldn't have done this.

  - document when deprecated methods will be removed.

0.28      2014-12-08 12:43:53 -0500

0.27      2014-08-20 03:54:14 -0400

0.20      2013-11-05 10:19:20 -0500
  - prevent multiple finish callbacks in unusual cases (Toshio Ito gh#15)

0.19      2013-11-04 07:26:19 -0500
  [AE::WS::Connection enhacements (thanks Toshio Ito)]
  - Automatically respond to a close frame with a close frame (RFC6455 5.5.1)
  - Make sure "finish" callbacks are called only once.
  - Automatically shutdown the socket on "finish" event. This makes sure EOF signal is sent to the peer.
  - Refuse to send/receive frames after it sends/receives a close frame. (RFC6455 1.4, 5.5.1)
  - Abort the connection when it receives a too huge message. The size limit is imposed by Protocol::WebSocket::Frame (RFC6455 10.4)
  - Automatically respond to a ping frame with a pong frame of the same payload (RFC6455 5.5.2, 5.5.3)
  - Add "masked" attribute. If set, outgoing frames are masked.
  - Client's Connection now sets masked => true (RFC6455 5.3, 6.1).

# ABSTRACT: WebSocket connection for AnyEvent
# VERSION

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # send a message through the websocket...
 $connection->send('a message');
 
 # recieve message from the websocket...
 $connection->on(each_message => sub {
   # $connection is the same connection object
   # $message isa AnyEvent::WebSocket::Message
   my($connection, $message) = @_;
   ...
 });
 
 # handle a closed connection...
 $connection->on(finish => sub {
   # $connection is the same connection object
   my($connection) = @_;
   ...
 });
 
 # close an opened connection
 # (can do this either inside or outside of
 # a callback)
 $connection->close;

(See L<AnyEvent::WebSocket::Client> or L<AnyEvent::WebSocket::Server> on
how to create a connection)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents a WebSocket connection with a remote server or a
client.

If the connection object falls out of scope then the connection will be
closed gracefully.

This class was created for a client to connect to a server via
L<AnyEvent::WebSocket::Client>, and was later extended to work on the
server side via L<AnyEvent::WebSocket::Server>.  Once a WebSocket
connection is established, the API for both client and server is
identical.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 handle

The underlying L<AnyEvent::Handle> object used for the connection.
WebSocket handshake MUST be already completed using this handle.
You should not use the handle directly after creating L<AnyEvent::WebSocket::Connection> object.

Usually only useful for creating server connections, see below.

=cut

has handle => (
  is       => 'ro',
  required => 1,
);

=head2 masked

If set to true, it masks outgoing frames. The default is false.

=cut

has masked => (
  is      => 'ro',
  default => sub { 0 },
);

=head2 subprotocol

The subprotocol returned by the server.  If no subprotocol was requested, it
may be C<undef>.

=cut

has subprotocol => (
  is => 'ro',
);

=head2 max_payload_size

The maximum payload size for received frames.  Currently defaults to whatever
L<Protocol::WebSocket> defaults to.

=cut

has max_payload_size => (
  is => 'ro',
);

=head2 max_fragments

The maximum number of fragments for received frames.  Currently defaults to whatever
L<Protocol::WebSocket> defaults to.

=cut

has max_fragments => (
  is => 'ro',
);

=head2 close_code

If provided by the other side, the code that was provided when the
connection was closed.

=cut

has close_code => (
  is => 'rw',
);

=head2 close_reason

If provided by the other side, the reason for closing the connection.

=cut

has close_reason => (
  is => 'rw',
);

=head2 close_error

If the connection is closed due to a network error, this will hold the
message.

=cut

has close_error => (
  is => 'rw',
);

  # Message processing (calling _process_message) is delayed by
  # $are_callbacks_supposed_to_be_ready flag. This is necessary to
  # make sure all received messages are delivered to each_message and
  # next_message callbacks. If there is some data in rbuf, changing
  # the on_read callback makes the callback fire, but there is of
  # course no each_message/next_message callback to receive the
  # message yet. So we put messages to @temp_messages for a
  # while. After the control is returned to the user, who sets up
  # each_message/next_message callbacks, @temp_messages are processed.

  # An alternative approach would be temporarily disabling on_read by
  # $self->handle->on_read(undef). However, this can cause a weird
  # situation in TLS mode, because on_eof can fire even if we don't
  # have any on_read (

=head1 METHODS

=head2 send

 $connection->send($message);

Send a message to the other side.  C<$message> may either be a string
(in which case a text message will be sent), or an instance of
L<AnyEvent::WebSocket::Message>.

=cut

sub send
{
  my($self, $message) = @_;
  my $frame;

  return $self if !$self->_is_write_open;

  if(ref $message)
  {
    $frame = Protocol::WebSocket::Frame->new(opcode => $message->opcode, buffer => $message->body, masked => $self->masked, max_payload_size => 0);
  }
  else
  {
    $frame = Protocol::WebSocket::Frame->new(buffer => $message, masked => $self->masked, max_payload_size => 0);
  }
  $self->handle->push_write($frame->to_bytes);
  $self;
}

=head2 on

 $connection->on(each_message => $cb);
 $connection->on(each_message => $cb);
 $connection->on(finish => $cb);

Register a callback to a particular event.

For each event C<$connection> is the L<AnyEvent::WebSocket::Connection> and
and C<$message> is an L<AnyEvent::WebSocket::Message> (if available).

Returns a coderef that unregisters the callback when invoked.

 my $cancel = $connection->on( each_message => sub { ...  });
 
 # later on...
 $cancel->();

=head3 each_message

 $cb->($connection, $message, $unregister)

Called each time a message is received from the WebSocket.
C<$unregister> is a coderef that removes this callback from
the active listeners when invoked.

=head3 next_message

 $cb->($connection, $message)

Called only for the next message received from the WebSocket.

[0.49]

Adding a next_message callback from within a next_message callback will
result in a callback called on the next message instead of the current
one. There was a bug in previous versions where the callback would be
called immediately after current set of callbacks with the same message.

=head3 parse_error

 $cb->($connection, $text_error_message)

Called if there is an error parsing a message sent from the remote end.
After this callback is called, the connection will be closed.
Among other possible errors, this event will trigger if a frame has a
payload which is larger that C<max_payload_size>.

=head3 finish

 $cb->($connection, $message)

Called when the connection is terminated.  If the connection is terminated
due to an error, the message will be provided as the second argument.
On a cleanly closed connection this will be `undef`.

=cut

sub _cancel_for
{
  my( $self, $event, $handler ) = @_;

  my $handler_id = Scalar::Util::refaddr($handler);

  }
  else
  {
    Carp::croak "unrecongized event: $event";
  }

  return $self->_cancel_for($event,$cb);
}

=head2 close

 $connection->close;
 $connection->close($code);
 $connection->close($code, $reason);

Close the connection.  You may optionally provide a code and a reason.
See L<section 5.5.1|https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-5.5.1> and L<section 7.4.1|https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-7.4.1> of RFC6455.

The code is a 16-bit unsigned integer value that indicates why you close the connection. By default the code is 1000.

The reason is a character string (not an octet string) that further describes why you close the connection. By default the reason is an empty string.

=cut

sub close
{
  my($self, $code, $reason) = @_;

  my $body = pack('n', ($code) ? $code : '1000');

  $body .= Encode::encode 'UTF-8', $reason if defined $reason;

  $self->send(AnyEvent::WebSocket::Message->new(
    opcode => 8,
    body => $body,
  ));
  $self->handle->push_shutdown;

  # I am not 100% sure about this, but maybe as a trade off it isn't

=head1 SERVER CONNECTIONS

Although written originally to work with L<AnyEvent::WebSocket::Client>,
this class was designed to be used for either client or server WebSocket
connections.  For details, contact the author and/or take a look at the
source for L<AnyEvent::WebSocket::Client> and the examples that come with
L<Protocol::WebSocket>.

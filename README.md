WebSocket client for AnyEvent

# SYNOPSIS

```perl
use AnyEvent::WebSocket::Client 0.12;

my $client = AnyEvent::WebSocket::Client->new;

$client->connect("ws://localhost:1234/service")->cb(sub {

  # make $connection an our variable rather than
  # my so that it will stick around.  Once the
  # connection falls out of scope any callbacks
  # tied to it will be destroyed.
  our $connection = eval { shift->recv };
  if($@) {
    # handle error...
    warn $@;
    return;
  }

  # send a message through the websocket...
  $connection->send('a message');

  # recieve message from the websocket...
  $connection->on(each_message => sub {
    # $connection is the same connection object
    # $message isa AnyEvent::WebSocket::Message
    my($connection, $message) = @_;
    ...
  });

  # handle a closed connection...
  $connection->on(finish => sub {
    # $connection is the same connection object
    my($connection) = @_;
    ...
  });

  # close the connection (either inside or
  # outside another callback)
  $connection->close;

});

## uncomment to enter the event loop before exiting.
## Note that calling recv on a condition variable before
## it has been triggered does not work on all event loops
#AnyEvent->condvar->recv;
```

# DESCRIPTION

This class provides an interface to interact with a web server that provides
services via the WebSocket protocol in an [AnyEvent](https://metacpan.org/pod/AnyEvent) context.  It uses
[Protocol::WebSocket](https://metacpan.org/pod/Protocol::WebSocket) rather than reinventing the wheel.  You could use
[AnyEvent](https://metacpan.org/pod/AnyEvent) and [Protocol::WebSocket](https://metacpan.org/pod/Protocol::WebSocket) directly if you wanted finer grain
control, but if that is not necessary then this class may save you some time.

The recommended API was added to the [AnyEvent::WebSocket::Connection](https://metacpan.org/pod/AnyEvent::WebSocket::Connection)
class with version 0.12, so it is recommended that you include that version
when using this module.  The older version of the API has since been
deprecated and removed.

# ATTRIBUTES

## timeout

Timeout for the initial connection to the web server.  The default
is 30.

## ssl\_no\_verify

If set to true, then secure WebSockets (those that use SSL/TLS) will
not be verified.  The default is false.

## ssl\_ca\_file

Provide your own CA certificates file instead of using the system default for
SSL/TLS verification.

## protocol\_version

The protocol version.  See [Protocol::WebSocket](https://metacpan.org/pod/Protocol::WebSocket) for the list of supported
WebSocket protocol versions.

## subprotocol

List of subprotocols to request from the server.  This class will throw an
exception if none of the protocols are supported by the server.

## http\_headers

Extra headers to include in the initial request.  May be either specified
as a hash reference, or an array reference.  For example:

```perl
AnyEvent::WebSocket::Client->new(
  http_headers => {
    'X-Foo' => 'bar',
    'X-Baz' => [ 'abc', 'def' ],
  },
);

AnyEvent::WebSocket::Client->new(
  http_headers => [
    'X-Foo' => 'bar',
    'X-Baz' => 'abc',
    'X-Baz' => 'def',
  ],
);
```

Will generate:

```
X-Foo: bar
X-Baz: abc
X-Baz: def
```

Although, the order cannot be guaranteed when using the hash style.

## max\_payload\_size

The maximum payload size for received frames.  Currently defaults to whatever
[Protocol::WebSocket](https://metacpan.org/pod/Protocol::WebSocket) defaults to.

## max\_fragments

The maximum number of fragments for received frames.  Currently defaults to whatever
[Protocol::WebSocket](https://metacpan.org/pod/Protocol::WebSocket) defaults to.

## env\_proxy

If you set true to this boolean attribute, it loads proxy settings
from environment variables. If it finds valid proxy settings,
`connect` method will use that proxy.

Default: false.

For `ws` WebSocket end-points, first it reads `ws_proxy` (or
`WS_PROXY`) environment variable. If it is not set or empty string,
then it reads `http_proxy` (or `HTTP_PROXY`). For `wss` WebSocket
end-points, it reads `wss_proxy` (`WSS_PROXY`) and `https_proxy`
(`HTTPS_PROXY`) environment variables.

# METHODS

## connect

```perl
my $cv = $client->connect($uri)
my $cv = $client->connect($uri, $host, $port);
```

Open a connection to the web server and open a WebSocket to the resource
defined by the given URL.  The URL may be either an instance of [URI::ws](https://metacpan.org/pod/URI::ws),
[URI::wss](https://metacpan.org/pod/URI::wss), or a string that represents a legal WebSocket URL.

You can  override the connection host and port by passing them in as the
second and third argument.  These values (if provided) are passed directly
into [AnyEvent::Socket](https://metacpan.org/pod/AnyEvent::Socket)'s `tcp_connect` function, so please note that
function's idiosyncrasies in the [AnyEvent::Socket](https://metacpan.org/pod/AnyEvent::Socket) documentation.  In
particular,  you can pass in `unix/` as the host and a filesystem path
as the "port" to connect to a unix domain socket.

This method will return an [AnyEvent](https://metacpan.org/pod/AnyEvent) condition variable which you can
attach a callback to.  The value sent through the condition variable will
be either an instance of [AnyEvent::WebSocket::Connection](https://metacpan.org/pod/AnyEvent::WebSocket::Connection) or a croak
message indicating a failure.  The synopsis above shows how to catch
such errors using `eval`.

# FAQ

## My program exits before doing anything, what is up with that?

See this FAQ from [AnyEvent](https://metacpan.org/pod/AnyEvent):
[AnyEvent::FAQ#My-program-exits-before-doing-anything-whats-going-on](https://metacpan.org/pod/AnyEvent::FAQ#My-program-exits-before-doing-anything-whats-going-on).

It is probably also a good idea to review the [AnyEvent](https://metacpan.org/pod/AnyEvent) documentation
if you are new to [AnyEvent](https://metacpan.org/pod/AnyEvent) or event-based programming.

## My callbacks aren't being called!

Make sure that the connection object is still in scope.  This often happens
if you use a `my $connection` variable and don't save it somewhere.  For
example:

```perl
$client->connect("ws://foo/service")->cb(sub {

  my $connection = eval { shift->recv };

  if($@)
  {
    warn $@;
    return;
  }

  ...
});
```

Unless `$connection` is saved somewhere it will get deallocated along with
any associated message callbacks will also get deallocated once the connect
callback is executed.  One way to make sure that the connection doesn't
get deallocated is to make it a `our` variable (as in the synopsis above)
instead.

# CAVEATS

This is pretty simple minded and there are probably WebSocket features
that you might like to use that aren't supported by this distribution.
Patches are encouraged to improve it.
